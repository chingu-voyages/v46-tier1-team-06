# Zero-Waste Recipes

## Overview:
Reduce food waste by searching our database for an ingredient that you have getting ready to spoil in your refrigerator or pantry.  You'll get a list of delicious recipes made with that exact ingredient.

## Features:

### [Design comp built on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JLp3V0M7hHHeFnvGYglq5Y/recipe-app?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=bgoSiYiUgFwDWgln-1)
- ![Responsive design features 1 recipe example in mobile](docs/img/readme/one-example-mobile.png) and 3 recipe examples in desktop to make finding the suggestions for use on the landing page easy to see
- Refresh button to easily navigate back to the homepage
### Built using Agile principles and SCRUM methodology 
- Team of 4 Developers: [Begum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/begumvernondeveloper/), [Erica](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charwaeericachong/), [Tauri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tauri-stclaire/), and [Terri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terri-fricker/).
- 6 week long sprints
- Tauri operated as designer and product owner in charge of managing the ![Sprint timeline](docs/img/readme/jira-timeline.png) and ![backlog on Jira](docs/img/readme/jira-board.png)

- Our team frequently employed pair programming to teach each other Sass and work on Javascript together
### Focus on Accessibility:
- 100% Accessibility Rating thru [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)!
- All colors for design checked with [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) and passed WCAG AAA ratings
- Fonts no smaller than 16px, ![larger readable recipe cards](docs/img/readme/readable-recipe-cards.png)
- All buttons inputs and icons are labeled for screen readers
- SVGs are used instead of fonticons to improve access for people who have adjusted their fonts in the browser
- all links and buttons labeled, aria-label for links and within the buttons with a class designating for screen readers only
- The "View Recipes" buttons and exit-buttons have an additional `aria-describedby`
attribute so that people who use screen readers are forewarned that a modal will be opening up then closing with each respective button
- All links have `aria-describedby` letting people who use screen readers know that it will open up a new tab and go to a different website
- Cards are clickable anywhere for people with mobility issues, but buttons are kept as anchor points for someone using keyboard only
### Dry Code focused on Readability:
- Sass: variables, ![partials](docs/img/readme/sass-partials.png), and nesting
- Semantic layout:
    - BEM for classes
- SVGs are coded into the HTML to decrease processing power, which is more green!
- ![Vanilla Javascript that prioritizes readability](docs/img/readme/readable-js.png)
    - Async fetch functions
    - Form validation
    - Functions declared so they are hoisted
